            <h3>Anti-Privatization</h3>
            <p>
              Water is a fundamental human right, yet privatization threatens affordability and accessibility. AGWWAS stands against corporate control,
              advocating for publicly owned and managed water services that prioritize people over profits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Privatization often leads to higher costs, reduced service quality, and exclusion of marginalized communities. Through collective action,
              we fight to keep water services under public control, ensuring transparency, accountability, and equitable distribution for everyone.
            </p>

            <h3>People Over Profit</h3>
            <p>
              Corporate interests should not dictate access to essential resources. Our 'People Over Profit' campaign calls for policies that prioritize
              community well-being over private gain. We support sustainable and fair water management for all.

              We push for policies that protect workers' rights, promote sustainable water management, and safeguard public access to clean and affordable water.
              By strengthening community participation and holding decision-makers accountable, we work towards a system that values human dignity over financial gain.
